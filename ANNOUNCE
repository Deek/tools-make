**************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.6.8 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version '2.6.8'
==============================

Configure option '-with-library-combo=ng-gnu-gnu' to use the 'Next
Generation' setup of the latest ObjectiveC-2 runtime and compiler
features rather than traditional runtime.  Requires the new runtime and
a recent clang compiler.

   Command line option 'documentation=no' to suppress builds of
documentation.

   Integration of testsuite for regression/unit testing of libraries
using the 'check' target.  In your makefile define libraryname_TEST_DIR
= TestsSubdirectory

   Various minor bugfixes, documentation spelling corrections etc.

   The '-enable-strict-v2-mode' option is now, after eight years, turned
on by default (in anticipation of finally removing backward
compatibility with version one).  WARNING; Packagers please ensure that
you update any old gnustep-make version one makefiles.

   Garbage collection support to be removed at the next release.

1.3 Obtaining gnustep-make
